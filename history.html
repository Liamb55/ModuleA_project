      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Leinster Branch was formally inaugerated at a meeting in October 1879.
        The first interprovincal matches between Munster Leinster and Ulster was 
        held in 1879, which resulted in a draw. The first formal interprovincial matchs

        but beat Munster. Connaught joined the group in 1885. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Amateur Period (1900 to 1990)</h2>
      <p>
        The 1920's led to the establishment of the Provincial Towns Cup and Metropolitan Cup.
        Matches were abandoned during the First and Second World wars. The first official overseas
        touring side to play Leinster was Australia in 1957. Matches were played in the 
        rugby ground at Donnybrook. <br> 
      </p>
      <h2>Leinster Lions (1990 - 2005)</h2>
      <p>
        Leinster became a professional team in the 1990's. During the period 2001/2002 they were 
      called the "Leinster Lions" though the lions element was dropped around 2005, though the Leinster
      Mascot is still "Leo the Lion". In 2002, Leinster beat Munster in the final of the newly formed 
      Celtic League. However, the following year had their worst performance and failed to qualify from 
      their european cup Group.</p> <br>

      <h2>Period 2004 to 2014</h2>
      <p>
      However, in the 2004 season, Leinster finished third in the European Cup. In 2005/2006, Leinster 
      progressed to the Semi-final of the European Cup but were Beated by Munster at Lansdown Road. The 
      following year they reached the quarter final but were beaten by London Wasps. 
      In 2007/2008 while failing to get out of their group, they did win the Celtic League beating Newport 
      Gwent Dragons. <br><br>In 2009, Leinster won the European Cup, beating Leicester Tigers 19 to 16. In 2011,
       they achieved their second European Cup being only the second team to do it at that time.
      In 2012/2013 Leinster won the European Challenge Cup beating Stade Francais in addition to winning the 
      Pro 12.</p>

      <h2> Present Day Leinster</h2>
      <p> In 2015, the Champions Cup was formed with Leinster reaching the semifinals but were beaton by 
        Toulon. At this time, Leo Cullen was appointed manager and he brought in former england rugby manager 
        Stuart Lancaster. This brought quick results with Leinster winning four straight Pro 14 championships.
